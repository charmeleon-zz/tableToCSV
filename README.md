## README

This is a quick jQuery plugin to turn a table into CSV. Eventually it could 
trigger a file download by taking advantage of data-uri and the download
 attribute for anchors.

### USAGE

As this is a jQuery plugin, you can simply call

    $('#sometable').tableToCSV();

Which should return the table contents in CSV format

### TODO
* Add tests
* Trigger document download
* Add flags documentation
